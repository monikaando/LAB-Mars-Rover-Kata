What this program do?    
        Program is moving Your Rover called Momo (the main robot) on a grid according to orders (l r f b --- > left / right / forward / backward) which got from you.
        Momo can meet an obstacle like '#' which program generate randomly.
        Momo can also have collisions with other robots.
        Momo starts from [x:0, y:0] (if you don't change it).
   2) What you can modify to play?
        You can use letters: l r f b (left / right / forward / backward) to tell Momo where to go.
        you simply replace letters on the end of the code: (rover, "lfbblfffffrrffbrffffrbbbb");
        You can also modify directions, x, y of rovers objects.
        You can uncomment 3 additional Rovers.
        You can also modify numbers of totalObstacles.
    Enjoy!
